# Guessing Game Challenge

Your employer, Electric Ants, has tasked you with developing the newest entry in their web-based Triple-A titles, "Guessing Game". The idea behind it is to have the computer randomly generate a number between 1 and 10, the user must enter a number in the box, click guess, and the computer checks if the answer is correct or not.
This game will revolutionize the web-based gaming industry, and could lead to further projects with Electric Ants!

`Reminder: read the goals and match a concept js to each goal`
