# CHALLENGE, ASYNC/AWAIT

Here you have a function named `retrieveLocation` that takes in a location's id
as the first argument (named id via the first parameter). Using this id that
is recieved, craft a fetch using "await", retrieve the data from the body using
"await", and return the location's name from the data.

Please do not modify the HTML file or any lines in the JS file that state to not modify!

Your challenge is as follows:
- Make the function "retrieveLocation" asynchronous.
- Use await to fetch a location using the id.
- Retrieve the data from the body using await.
- Return that location's name from the function.
